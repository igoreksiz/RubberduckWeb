        Or help us do it! Rubberduck is a very active open-source COM add-in project that integrates with the Visual Basic Editor to enable the features every programmer wants to have in their IDE.
        From unit testing to code inspections and refactorings, programming in VBA will never be the same.

        <h2>Unit Testing</h2>
        <p>Rubberduck gives you a powerful and fully integrated test environment for your VBA code.</p>
        <p class="text-center"><img src="~/Content/Images/TestExplorer01Cropped.png" alt="Test Explorer dockable toolwindow" class="border-image" /></p>
        <p>That's right. Unit testing. In VBA.</p>

            Since the project's early days, JetBrains' Open-Source team has been supporting Rubberduck with free OSS licenses for all core contributors - and we deeply thank them for that. ReSharper has been not only a tool we couldn't do without; it's been an inspiration, the ultimate level of polished perfection to strive for in our own IDE add-in project. So just like you're missing out if you write VBA and you're not using Rubberduck, you're missing out if you write C# and aren't using ReSharper.
